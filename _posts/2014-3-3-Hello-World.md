## Let me introduce Attentionverse 

On our website we say "Captialism optimises allocation of scarcity to create capacity. It fails in abundance. We are creating live streamed community owned companies to catalyse execution & innovation as we move towards the age of abundance." and we mean it. 

But live-streaming a company is hard, as first and foremost running a company is hard. Especially one that wants to become an ecosystem of creating moonshot projects by creating infrastructure for such an ecosystem via moonshot projects. 

This is the very recepie of failure we have been trying to cook for over an year now. From August 2022 onwards we will be executing more publically, across multiple platforms, trying to maintain a common thread. If you're really curious what all we have been upto you can go into the <attentionverse.com> rabbithole.


## What's cooking in the August of 2022 ?

Well, we are trying to ship three of our products - The Coder, Repetition, and Else - in this order. Mainly because The Coder is supposed to be the bread earner. The Coder is a no-code app/website maker. I want to launch it at the end of this blog post. Let's see. Repetition is a skilling platform, and Else is a discovery platform. All of these are hard problems, no wonder our June 4 launch for all three quietly transitioned into an internal demo !

I know, my timelines suck. But then we are creating exceptional stuff. Like some of it is exceptional. Maybe. Aaah the creeping self doubt. Let's focus.

The Coder, still doesn't have a public facing url, mainly because I hate the internal UI we are using. I would rather have a one-job product with neat UI, that a holistic product with crap all over your screen. Also, it's sort of incomplete. We are amazing at creating screens and their dummy data and backends. We haven't graduated to a complete app. And the story why we haven't is an interesting thesis in how I work. 

So we created this single-screen app-maker and I was playing with it to add more features, as my team was makiing it's public facing UI for launch. As I played, I realised I could make the UI of a long stalled project, Else, so I continued to do that and did that. That was also done within a week, this is May. Good so for, then I spent large part of May in curating great channels in Youtube for the "wow" experience, and by the end of May realised post demos that both The Coder and Repetition were in shambles. I was livid.

I had another target in the next couple of weeks I was travelling to India's Silicon Valley to hang out with friends, and take feelers on what's up with everyone, and I met 25% of the people I should and could have, just because the products were still not at the "wow" level. Though I did come back with some valuable insights. 

First, positioning. Attentionverse is too confusing for people. The Coder is easier to picture, because of Hcode, and being the CTO of my previous startups, everyone associates me with tech. It also neatly fits with Repetition, which teaches coding for starters. That's about it. The Coder writes code, and Repetition teaches you coding.Second, product focus - high volume problems of people selling or trying to sell in e-commerce.

Coming back I did some major changes. Got one member into full time product maangement. Now we have a neat excel sheet, and the target is that I only see the output in terms of deadlines - features, demos, and releases. Though it breaks at times, it's much more streamlined. It's still not self-sufficient to the extent that they won't be able to launch something like Else on their own, but something standard with backend API and screens. Everything else needs a lot of hammering. 

## What's with the live-streaming ?

That's one of the four targets in August. First, is realeasing the product. Second, sales (and some marketing). Third is live-streaming. Fourth, and the most despised, the leagalease of all of it - the companies, the taxes, the compliances - hate them.

We have experimented alot with live-streaming over the last year and have finally been able to standardize some facets of it. Those learnings combined with the inherent abilities of The Coder platform should allow us to bring an exceptional amount of insight into running of a company.
